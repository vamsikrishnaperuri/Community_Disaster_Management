## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Imagine a disaster strikes. What are the common issues?

* **Lack of Real-Time Data:** How do you know what's happening *right now*?
* **Verification Challenges:** Who do you trust when information is flying?
* **Limited Access to Emergency Resources:** Where's the nearest shelter?
* **Inefficient Resource Mobilization:** How do help and supplies get where they're needed fast?
